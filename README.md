Step 1: Import Required Module
Begin by importing the random module, which you'll use to enable the computer to randomly choose its move.
Step 2: Define the Moves
Define a list that contains the three possible moves in the game: "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".
Step 3: Computer's Choice
Use the random module to randomly select the computer's move from the list of possible moves.
Step 4: User Input
Prompt the user to enter their move. It's a good idea to accept inputs in a flexible manner (e.g., any case) and validate the input to ensure it's one of the allowed moves.
Step 5: Determine the Winner
Implement a series of conditions to compare the user's choice and the computer's choice and determine the winner. Consider all possible outcomes:
The user and the computer choose the same move (tie).
The user wins (e.g., Rock crushes Scissors).
The computer wins.
For each condition, print out an appropriate message that shows the user's choice, the computer's choice, and who won the round.
Step 6: Replayability
After a game round finishes, ask the user if they want to play again. If they do, repeat the game. If not, exit the program.
You might want to wrap the gameplay (steps 3-5) in a loop that continues until the user decides to stop playing.
Step 7: Handling Invalid Input
It's important to handle cases where the user might enter an invalid move. Prompt them again until they enter a valid move.
You might use a loop that continues to ask for input until a valid move is provided. """
